## Description

Small project to try out different middleware

A load balancer that distributes network or application traffic across a cluster of servers. It helps optimize resource utilization, improve scalability, and enhance the availability and reliability of applications.

## Middleware

The load balancer project implements the following middleware:

- Logging Middleware: Logs incoming requests and outgoing responses for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Rate Limiting Middleware: Limits the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- Exception Middleware: Handles exceptions and errors that occur during request processing, providing appropriate responses and error handling.
